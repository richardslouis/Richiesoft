<strong>About these Terms</strong><br><br><p>

We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.

If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict. These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p><br><p>
If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p><br><p>

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p><br><p>

The courts in some countries will not apply Indian law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where Indian law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of India, excluding India’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. </p><br><br><br>
