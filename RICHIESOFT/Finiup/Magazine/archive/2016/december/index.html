							<h1>Dec 2016 | Finiup</h1>
							<p class="major"><!--[-->It is our pleasure to bring the last issue of Finiup for the year 2016. This year has been a roller-coaster ride for Indian startups; and as we bid adieu to 2016, we can’t help but reflect on the key developments of the year. We witnessed that merely scoring high-value funding and lot of hype is not going to see through the startups’ journey to become a large business. Many startups had to see the end of the day through the year mainly for such reasons. Sustainable scaling up of the business, building internal and external capabilities, and eventually, delivering world-class services to customers within stipulated budgets is also very important for a startup to survive and thrive. Learn to manage your remote teams, manage with the finances’ issue and a lot more to enjoy in the pages of Finiup. Enjoy!<!--]--></p>
